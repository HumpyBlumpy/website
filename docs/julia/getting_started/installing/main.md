# Installing ITensor

Installing the Julia version of ITensor is easy once you
have the Julia language installed. For more information about
installing Julia, please see <a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">the Julia language downloads page</a>.

Once you have installed Julia on your machine,

1. launch an interactive Julia session by typing `julia` (a.k.a. the Julia "REPL")
2. type `]` to enter the package manager (`pkg>` prompt should now show)
3. enter the command `add ITensors`
4. after installation completes, press backspace to return to the normal `julia>` prompt
