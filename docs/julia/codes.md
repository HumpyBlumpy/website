# ITensor Codes (Julia Language)

Open-source codes based on ITensor for a variety projects and tasks.
If you have a high-quality code you'd like listed here, please
<a href="about.html">contact us</a>. Codes extending core ITensor
features may become candidates for inclusion in ITensor at a later date.

(Codes listed as maintained by "ITensor" are officially maintained by the developers
of the ITensor library and will be tested against and updated along with the ITensor library.
Other codes are maintained separately from ITensor by the maintainers
shown next to each code. Please contact them directly if you have any issues 
with or questions about the codes.)

ITensorsGPU extends the ITensor library by allowing ITensors to have GPU storage. These ITensors are allocated in GPU memory and use fast, parallelized CUDA GPU routines for operations such as tensor contraction and factorization, which can result in very large speedups.
