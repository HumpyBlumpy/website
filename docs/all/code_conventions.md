# ITensor Library C++ Conventions #

None of these conventions are hard and fast, and there exist exceptions throughout the library.
However, the conventions below should be followed whenever reasonable.


## Classes and Structs ##

* Class names are capitalized.

* Class methods are camel-cased e.g. `obj.doThing(...)` not `obj.do_thing(...)`.

* Private class data members are underscore spaced and end in an underscore.
  For example, `last_energy_` or `curr_index_`.

* Class methods modifying objects do not return a copy (though may return a reference). 
  For example, `I.prime()` increments the prime level of `Index I` in place.

* Free methods modifying objects return a copy. For example, 
  `prime(I)` returns a copy of `I` with its prime level incremented.

## File Layout ##

* Each header file should primarily contain one class definition, although other
closely related helper classes may be included (such as the commaInit class for 
initializing ITensors, defined in itensor.h).

* Except for class definitions, function declarations, and very short inline functions (i.e. one, perhaps
two lines), all other code goes either at the end of a header
file or in a separate .cc file.



## Formatting ##

* Code should be idented using 4 spaces for each indent level ("soft tabs"). This guarantees
the code will look consistent in text editors regardless of tab stop settings.

* Code should be no more than 80 characters wide. Possible exceptions include long string literals or
if breaking over two lines makes code hard to reason about/debug.

* Braces following function or class declarations, etc., should be on their own line and 
  be indented to the same level as the enclosed code. For example:

        Real
        absSqrt(Real x)
          {
          if(x >= 0)
              return sqrt(x);
          else
              return sqrt(-x);
          }

* The return type of functions and class methods appears at the beginning of the line preceding the function name:

        Real
        calculateSomething(ITensor const& A, ITensor const& B);

  Other keywords such as `friend` or `inline` should come after the return type unless disallowed by the compiler
  (such as when the return type is a reference).

* Braces can be omitted in if..else, for, or while statements containing a single expression, for example:

          if(i == 0)
              return 0;
          else
              return 2*i;
  
  However, if any branch of an if..else contains more than one line, all of the branches should be enclosed by braces:

          if(i == 0)
              {
              cout << "Encountered i==0 case" << endl;
              return 0;
              }
          else
              {
              return 2*i;
              }

* Types are written in the order:
  1. Typename (such as ITensor)
  2. Modifiers (such as const, &, const&, etc.)
  3. Variable name

  <br/>
  For example, in a function declaration


      f(ITensor const& T, Real const* real_pointer);

  Or in binding a variable to a const reference:

      auto const& ref = x;


## Functions ##

* The preferred order for function arguments is:
    1. Regular (pass-by-value, such as `int j`) and const reference (such as `const MPO& H`) arguments.
    2. Non-const reference or pointer arguments.
    3. Arguments with defaults (required to come last anyway).
