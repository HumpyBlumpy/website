# Contributing Documentation

The "Learn" section of the ITensor website is set up to be extremely easy to edit,
so as to encourage user contributions. Every page is generated on the fly from
a text file in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, which is 
somewhat similar to the structured text used on sites such as Wikipedia.

Also, the documentation system supports MathJax, making it easy to embed LaTeX 
expressions directly into pages. View the source of [[this page|book/trg]] for 
an example ([link to page source on Github](https://github.com/ITensor/website/blob/master/docs/book/trg.md)).

To contribute, just clone the ITensor/website code repository on GitHub:
[https://github.com/ITensor/website](https://github.com/ITensor/website).

To send your edits, fork this repo and create a pull request with your changes.

Or, email a new documentation file (plain text with Markdown formatting) to Miles Stoudenmire 
(estouden at domain uci.edu).
