# Perform a basic DMRG calculation #

Because tensor indices in ITensor have unique identities, before we can make a Hamiltonian
or a wavefunction we need to construct a "site set" which will hold the site indices defining
the physical Hilbert space:

    auto sites = SpinOne(N);

Here we have chosen to use the SpinOne site set to create a Hilbert space of N 
spin 1 sites.

Next we'll make our Hamiltonian matrix product operator (MPO). A very 
convenient way to do this is to use the AutoMPO helper class which lets 
us input a Hamiltonian (or any sum of local operators) in similar notation
to pencil-and-paper notation:

    auto ampo = AutoMPO(sites);
    for(int j = 1; j < N; ++j)
        {
        ampo += 0.5,"S+",j,"S-",j+1;
        ampo += 0.5,"S-",j,"S+",j+1;
        ampo +=     "Sz",j,"Sz",j+1;
        }
    auto H = toMPO(ampo);

In the last line above we convert the AutoMPO helper object to an actual MPO.

Before beginning the calculation, we need to specify how many DMRG sweeps to do and
what schedule we would like for the parameters controlling the accuracy.
These parameters are stored within a sweeps object:

    auto sweeps = Sweeps(5); //number of sweeps is 5
    sweeps.maxdim() = 10,20,100,100,200; //gradually increase states kept
    sweeps.cutoff() = 1E-10; //desired truncation error

The wavefunction must be defined in the same Hilbert space
as the Hamiltonian, so we construct it using the same site set object as before

    auto psi = MPS(sites);

By default an MPS created this way is initialized to a random product state; we could also set psi
to some specific initial state using an [[InitState|classes/initstate]] object.

Finally, we are ready to call DMRG:

    auto energy = dmrg(psi,H,sweeps);

When the algorithm is done, it returns the ground state energy. The variable psi
is overwritten with optimized ground state wavefunction on return.

Below you can find a complete working code that includes all of these steps,
along with the headers you need to include to obtain all of the necessary library code.

    #include "itensor/all.h"

    using namespace itensor;

    int 
    main()
        {
        int N = 100;

        auto sites = SpinOne(N);

        auto ampo = AutoMPO(sites);
        for(int j = 1; j < N; ++j)
            {
            ampo += 0.5,"S+",j,"S-",j+1;
            ampo += 0.5,"S-",j,"S+",j+1;
            ampo +=     "Sz",j,"Sz",j+1;
            }
        auto H = toMPO(ampo);

        auto sweeps = Sweeps(5); //number of sweeps is 5
        sweeps.maxdim() = 10,20,100,100,200;
        sweeps.cutoff() = 1E-10;

        auto psi = MPS(sites);

        auto energy = dmrg(psi,H,sweeps);

        println("Ground State Energy = ",energy);

        return 0;
        }
